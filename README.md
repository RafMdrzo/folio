## How to run
Accessing the app via the Heroku deployment is easier since the database is already being hosted in the cloud. Do note that it also has the same sample data.

OPTIONAL: To minify public scripts, run grunt on the folder's directory via command line
1. Create MongoDB database named as folioDB. Create the collections: users, posts, comments, likes, followings, and followers.
2. Import the sample data from JSON files in the folder, **sample data**, to their respective collections.
3. Run the database.
4. Execute index.js.
5. Go to localhost:3000 or https://foliodb.herokuapp.com/. You'll be redirected to the login page. This is the behavior when you haven't logged in yet.
6. To login, enter **eugeniopastoral** and **helloworld** as the username and password respectively. Alternatively, you can use the usernames: **kychoa**, **rafmdrz**, and **kerbychua**. These accounts also have **helloworld** as their password.
7. You'll now be able to view and interact with posts. You can also modify your account and profile information. 
   You can also search for other existing users in the database.
8. To logout, click the avatar and press logout.

## Stuff to remember

1. After committing changes locally, don't forget to push those changes to the repository.
2. Don't push to **master** immediately. Instead, push to alternative branches. Committing changes to **master** should only be done once the code is finalized.
3. Before committing, proofread your commit message for spelling and grammatical errors.
